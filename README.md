Data Cleaning and Preprocessing - Task 1
Dataset Used: Mall Customer Segmentation Data
Tool: Python (Pandas)

Summary of Work
• The dataset originally contained 200 rows and 5 columns.
• Checked for missing values — none were found.
• Verified that there were no duplicate rows in the dataset.
• Column names were cleaned and standardized (converted to lowercase and underscores added).
• Gender values were formatted consistently (e.g., 'Male' and 'Female').
• Data types were corrected: age → integer, annual_income_(k$) → float, spending_score_(1-100) → integer.
• The dataset was then saved as 'cleaned_mall_customers.csv'.

Final Result
A clean, well-structured dataset with:
- 200 unique records
- No missing or duplicate values
- Consistent formatting and proper data types

The final file 'cleaned_mall_customers.csv' is now ready for analysis and visualization.
